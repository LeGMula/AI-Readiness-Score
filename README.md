# AI Readiness Score - Retail Sector Analysis  

## Overview  
This repository introduces the **AI Readiness Score**, a quantitative model designed to predict a company's AI adoption potential based on publicly available financial and operational data. The model aims to classify companies into:
- **AI Leaders**: Companies successfully leveraging AI for operational efficiency.
- **Turnaround Opportunities**: Companies with high potential but not yet fully utilizing AI.
- **AI Laggards**: Companies with limited potential for AI-driven transformation.

## Key Features  
‚úÖ **Data-Driven Classification:** Uses **10 years of financial data (2014-2024)** from the retail sector to predict AI readiness.  
‚úÖ **Custom AI Readiness Model:** Leverages **logistic regression & financial metrics** to classify companies.  
‚úÖ **Publicly Available Data:** Built using **Compustat** dataset with retail industry focus (SIC: 5200-5999).  
‚úÖ **Actionable Insights for Investors:** Provides an **AI adoption framework** for **Private Equity (PE) firms** to identify undervalued investment opportunities.

## Key Findings  
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **AI Leaders Start with High SG&A Ratios but Improve Over Time**  
üìå Companies that **initially had high SG&A (overhead costs)** but successfully reduced them **became AI Leaders**.  
üìå **SG&A reduction correlates strongly with EBITDA margin improvements**.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Turnaround Opportunities Have High Potential but Limited Progress**  
Some large companies **have high SG&A but haven't fully leveraged AI**.  
Examples: **McDonald's, Costco, Loblaw, Ahold Delhaize**.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **AI Laggards Often Had Strong Past Performance But Declined**  
 **Past high EBITDA margins do not guarantee AI readiness.**  
AI Laggards (e.g., Wendy's, Wingstop) **failed to improve operational efficiency** over time.

## Private Equity Implications  
 **How Can PE Investors Use This Model?**
- **Target Selection:** Identify **high SG&A firms with transformation potential** (best investment opportunities).  
- **Due Diligence Focus:** Use financial & operational metrics to **predict AI adoption success**.  
- **Value Creation Strategy:** Implement AI-driven cost reduction **early in the holding period** to maximize returns.
