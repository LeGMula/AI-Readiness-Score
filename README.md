# AI Readiness Score - Retail Sector Analysis  

## Overview  
This repository introduces the **AI Readiness Score**, a quantitative model designed to predict a company's AI adoption potential based on publicly available financial and operational data. The model aims to classify companies into:
- **AI Leaders**: Companies successfully leveraging AI for operational efficiency.
- **Turnaround Opportunities**: Companies with high potential but not yet fully utilizing AI.
- **AI Laggards**: Companies with limited potential for AI-driven transformation.

## Key Features  
✅ **Data-Driven Classification:** Uses **10 years of financial data (2014-2024)** from the retail sector to predict AI readiness.  
✅ **Custom AI Readiness Model:** Leverages **logistic regression & financial metrics** to classify companies.  
✅ **Publicly Available Data:** Built using **Compustat** dataset with retail industry focus (SIC: 5200-5999).  
✅ **Actionable Insights for Investors:** Provides an **AI adoption framework** for **Private Equity (PE) firms** to identify undervalued investment opportunities.

## 🏆 Key Findings  
### 1️⃣ **AI Leaders Start with High SG&A Ratios but Improve Over Time**  
📌 Companies that **initially had high SG&A (overhead costs)** but successfully reduced them **became AI Leaders**.  
📌 **SG&A reduction correlates strongly with EBITDA margin improvements**.

### 2️⃣ **Turnaround Opportunities Have High Potential but Limited Progress**  
📌 Some large companies **have high SG&A but haven't fully leveraged AI**.  
📌 Examples: **McDonald's, Costco, Loblaw, Ahold Delhaize**.

### 3️⃣ **AI Laggards Often Had Strong Past Performance But Declined**  
📌 **Past high EBITDA margins do not guarantee AI readiness.**  
📌 AI Laggards (e.g., Wendy's, Wingstop) **failed to improve operational efficiency** over time.
